# Pinball 99
For the TI-99/4A home computer

## Building the cartridge ROM
* Only tested under Windows
* The xdt99 tools from https://github.com/endlos99/xdt99 must be availbled on the path
* Run make.bat to build the cartridge ROM

## How to play
* To play you can use either keyboard: space, Z, M, B; or joystick 1: fire, left, right, up.
* During the game you can also use the flipper controls to roll the highlighted TI99 letters in the top bonus area left/right. A bonus multiplier will multiply all further points you get, so it's very important in order to get a high score.
* If the ball gets stuck you can press space/fire for a slight tilt.

## Acknowledgements
* PD tools to create collision maps were borrowed from the Pinball Dreams project for the C64.
* Table layout is based on Ignition table from Pinball Dreams.
